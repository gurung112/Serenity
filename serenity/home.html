                    Exploring this area's history is fascinating, and the  revolver-wielding evil man who died on the way to his trial in Denver, or the 1935 Memorial Day flood in which half the town washed away. It is easy to take a step back in time in this quiet, unassuming town. Head outside of town to view old wagon ruts dating back to 1865 left along the Smoky Hill Trail.
